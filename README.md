An agent-based model to simulate the energy landscape evolution
The VIABLE model framework is applied to the decision-making process of heterogeneous agents, who can adapt their investment decisions in electricity generation technologies at each iteration autonomously or in exchange with other agents. The model projects energy landscape dynamics for both unilateral and group decisions.
